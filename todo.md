TODO:
Improve efficiency using the 'precompute bilateral' method - need to do several rounds to ensure capture all possible
Set up more scenarios
Key:  Loss lines, supply sizes, demand sizes.
Implement spinner when loading



Set up scenario with two supplies close together with supply of 40, with demanders north, east south, west, close, with 11 each.  On one of these, we southern one is further south.


Then a supply much further south with lots of spare capacity.

* Build more interface
	* Supply adjust - but needs to not just read in whole dataset again when change supply
	*  
	* 



* Build info panels
